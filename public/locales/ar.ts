        Description:
          "Islamic knowledge is an essential part of the educational process in our school, where students learn the Quran and memorize its verses, along with the teachings of the Prophet. Students also learn the principles of Islam and the desirable behaviors of a Muslim. Arabic language is one of the core pillars of education at our school, where students learn basic grammar and actively practice it as one of the languages of instruction and communication. The school takes great care in strengthening Islamic identity and teachings, as well as preserving and practicing the Arabic language.",

        Description:
          "While prioritizing Islamic teachings and the Arabic language, we also value modern sciences. Therefore, the school has developed a unique curriculum that includes high-level Islamic and Arabic studies alongside the Cambridge curriculum for modern sciences. For Palestinian students, one of the school’s goals is to cultivate a generation connected to their homeland and prioritizing the Palestinian cause in a setting that constantly engages with Palestinian heritage and values.",

        Description:
          "Our main competitive advantage is providing quality education at a low cost, which is rare among schools that usually fall into either high-cost, high-quality, or low-cost, low-quality categories. A glance at our tuition fee structure compared to any international school in Birnin Kebbi reveals a significant difference.",

      Title: "The Beginnings of Bandex Science Academy",
      Para1:
        "In 2017, many Arab and foreign families in and around Birnin Kebbi tried to enroll their children in public schools, but most were unsuccessful for various reasons. They turned to private schools, hoping to find affordable and suitable educational environments, but could not.",
      Para2:
        "Many children remained out of school, staying at home since arriving in Nigeria. Families with children in schools often struggled financially due to high fees, especially as many parents were university students themselves. In some cases, they were dissatisfied with the academic or educational standards of the schools.",
      Para3:
        "At that point, a group of parents from these families decided to meet and discuss solutions to the educational challenges facing their children, ultimately deciding to create the solution themselves. They planned, raised some funds, identified a suitable building to rent, and established the school through their own efforts, officially opening in October 2018. Therefore, the school cannot be seen as a commercial venture; its sole purpose is to provide a suitable solution to a challenge faced by many families in the Birnin Kebbi area.",
